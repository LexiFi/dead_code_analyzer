- \[X\] Test suite
	+ \[X\] Detect FP
	+ \[X\] Detect FN
	+ \[X\] Add some color and info (stats, ...)

- The 'UNUSED EXPORTED VALUES' section may have both FN and FP (none known).
- The 'OPTIONAL ARGUMENTS' section has both FN and FP (due to 'ref' usage).
- The 'CODING STYLE' section may have both FN and FP (none known).
