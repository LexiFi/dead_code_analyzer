- improve *--types* option
- all kind of types
- objects
- classes
- `assoc` is not precise enough (-> FN on types)

#Fix
- Clean output
- Clean code!!


#Testing
- \[X\] Test suite
- \[ \] Test on big projects: see directory results
- \[ \] Create more precise tests
- \[ \] Create test for options


#Note
- The `UNUSED EXPORTED VALUES` section may have both FN and FP (none known).
- The `OPTIONAL ARGUMENTS` section has both FN and FP (due to `ref` usage).
- The `CODING STYLE` section may have both FN and FP (none known).

ratio: **97.2%** succesful (over 107 expected results)
