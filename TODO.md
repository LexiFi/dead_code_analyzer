# Work in Progress
- update doc
- code cleaning

# Waiting
- split type section (constructors and fields, can be transformed as abstract/private)
- literal objects
- handle module types correctly
- more precise on optional arguments (track dependencies)


# Testing
- \[X\] Test suite
- \[ \] Test on big projects: see directory `results`
- \[ \] Create more precise tests
- \[ \] Create tests for options


# Note
- The `UNUSED EXPORTED VALUES` section may have both FN and FP (none known).
- The `UNUSED CLASS FIELDS` section may have both FN and FP.
- The `UNUSED TYPES FIELDS/CONSTRUCTORS` section may have both FN and FP.
- The `OPTIONAL ARGUMENTS` sections may have both FN and FP.
- The `CODING STYLE` section may have both FN and FP (none known).

ratio: **100%** succesful (over 230 unique expected results)
