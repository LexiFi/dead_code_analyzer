# Work in Progress
- handling includes
- code cleaning
- objects

# Waiting
- cut output: "unused exported values" is lost its meaning: seperate types and obj from it
- improve options (rethink it)
- all kind of types


#Testing
- \[X\] Test suite
- \[ \] Test on big projects: see directory `results`
- \[ \] Create more precise tests
- \[ \] Create tests for options


#Note
- The `UNUSED EXPORTED VALUES` section may have both FN and FP (none known).
- The `OPTIONAL ARGUMENTS` section may have both FN and FP.
- The `CODING STYLE` section may have both FN and FP (none known).

ratio: **100%** succesful (over 192 unique expected results)
