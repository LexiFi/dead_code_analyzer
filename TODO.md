# Work in Progress
- finish methods
- code cleaning

# Waiting
- update doc
- handle module types better
- improve optional arguments memory cost
- more precise on optional arguments (track dependencies)
- handle branching (for methods and opt args)
- make check/\*.ml Str independent


# Testing
- \[X\] Test suite
- \[ \] Test on big projects: see directory `results`
- \[ \] Create more precise tests
- \[ \] Create tests for all options
