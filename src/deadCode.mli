(** dead_code_analyzer  --  Dead code analyzing tool. It only reports unused exported values,
  constructors/record fields and methods by default.
  Options can enable reporting of optional arguments always/never used as bad style of code.
  In addition to selecting which reports are to be displayed, the limit of authorized
  occurences needed to be reported can be selected (default is 0).

  It assumes .mli/.mfi are compiled with {e -keep-locs} and .ml/.mf are compiled with {e -bin-annot}.


  {2 Unused Exported Values}

  This section reports the following when exported:

  - Values never accessed.
      e.g. {[
        let x = 0
        let () = ()
      ]}
      Here, [x] will be reported.

  As this section focuses on exported values, internal calls are ignored by default.
  This will lead the analyzer to focus on values that are uselessly exported.
  To keep track of all uses, call the {e internal} option.

  Calling the dead code analyzer with {e -E threshold:1} on
     {[
        let x = 0
        let () = ignore x
      ]}
  will lead to reporting [x] in the almost unused subsection because its number of use <= 1.


  {2 Unused Constructors/Record Fields}

  - Record fields not read.
      e.g. {[
        type t = {foo: int; bar: bool}
        let r = {foo = 0; bar = false}
        let x = {r with bar = true}
        let () = ignore x.foo
      ]}
      Here, [t.bar] will be reported.

  - Constructors never constructed.
      e.g. {[
        type t = Foo | Bar
        let x = Foo
        let () = match x with
          | Bar -> ()
          | _ -> ()
      ]}
      Here, [t.Bar] will be reported.

  Types are studied as a whole and iff they are explicitly declared as their own types.
  Consequently, signatures as [val f: [`A | `B] -> unit] cannot lead to reporting [`A] or [`B].


  {2 Unused Methods}

  - Public methods never called.
      e.g. {[
        class p = object
          method f = ()
        end
        class c = object
          inherit p
          method g = ()
        end
        let () = c#f
      ]}
      Here, [c#g] will be reported.

  It has to be noted that calling [c#f] is in fact the same as calling [p#f].
  The owner is considered to be the one who defines the function.


  {2 Optional Arguments}

  Optional arguments always used (with a value <> [None])
  and never used (or only with [None]) are reported.

  This reporting is done regardless of whether the function an optional argument is
  attached to is exported.

      e.g. {[
        let f ?a ?b () = ()
        let () = f ~a:0 ()
      ]}
  Here [?a] is reported as always used and [?b] never.

  Calling the dead code analyzer with {e -Oa percent:0.6} on
      {[
        let f ?a ?b () = ()
        let () =
          f ~a:0 ()
          |> f ~a:0 ~b:0
          |> f ~a:0 ~b:0
      ]}
  will lead to reporting both [?a] in the always used section
and [?b] in the almost always used subsection.

  Calling the dead code analyzer with
  {e -Oa both:1,0.6} on
      {[
        let f ?a ?b () = ()
        let () =
          f ~a:0 ()
          |> f ~a:0 ~b:0
          |> f ~a:0 ~b:0
      ]}
  will lead to reporting [?a] but not [?b] because number of time it is used is > 1
  and the percentage of time it is unused is < 60%.


  {2 Coding Style}

  This section focuses on:
    - use of unit patterns as in [let f : unit -> unit = fun x -> ()].
      In this example x is reported as a unit pattern.
      Any value of type [unit] different from [()]
      like [let _ = ()] or [x] in the previous example is reported as a unit pattern.

    - unit bindings where sequencing should be used: [let () = ... in ...]

    - useless bindings of the form [let x = ... in x]

    - arguments expecting optional argument i.e. [val f: ... -> (... -> ?_:_ -> ...) -> ...]

{b --underscore}  Show names starting with an underscore

{b --verbose}  Verbose mode (ie., show scanned files)

{b -v}  See {b --verbose}

{b --internal}  Keep internal uses as exported values uses when the interface is given. This is the default behaviour when only the implementation is found

{b -a}  See {b --nothing}

{b --all}  Enable all warnings

{b -A}  See {b --all}

{b -E} <display>  Enable/Disable unused exported values warnings.
<display> can be:
- all
- nothing
- <threshold>
- "calls:<threshold>" like <threshold> + show call sites

{b -M} <display>  Enable/Disable unused methods warnings.
See option {b -E} for the syntax of <display>

{b -Oa} <display>  Enable/Disable optional arguments always used warnings.

<threshold> can be:
- "both:<integer>,<float>": both the number max of exceptions (given through the integer) and the percent of valid cases (given as a float) must be respected for the element to be reported

{b -On} <display>  Enable/Disable optional arguments never used warnings.
See option {b -Oa} for the syntax of <display>

{b -S}  Enable/Disable coding style warnings.
- Delimiters '+' and '-' determine if the following option is to enable or disable.
- Options (can be used together):
- bind: useless binding
- opt: optional arg in arg
