# dead code analyzer
Dead-code analyzer for OCaml

## Overview

This tool scans a compiled OCaml project and reports various warnings
about suspicious code:

 - Exported values never used.
   (The declaration can be dropped from the interface, and then from
   the implementation if there is no internal use -- which will be reported
   by standard OCaml warnings).

 - Optional arguments for which either all call sites or none of them
   provide a value. (The argument can be made mandatory or dropped.)

 - Other stylistic issues:  patterns matching a value of type `unit`
   which are not `()` (typically, `_` or a variable);  let-binding
   `let () = ... in ...` (it's usually better to use sequencing);
   let-binding of the form `let x = ... in x` (the binding is useless);
   optional argument in argument's type: `val f: ... -> (... -> ?_:_ -> ...) -> ...`


The tool assumes that .mli files are compiled with -keep-locs and .ml
files with -bin-annot.  Exported values are collected by reading .cmi or .cmt
files (depending on the existence of an explicit .mli interfaces).
References to such values are collected by reading typed trees from .cmt files

## Status
